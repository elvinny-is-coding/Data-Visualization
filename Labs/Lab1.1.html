    <p>Pets and the Pandemic</p>

    <p>
      A report from Animal Medicines Australia (AMA) has found that many
      Australians took the opportunity to introduce a pet into their household
      during the pandemic. Their survey indicated that there was a significant
      <b>increase</b> in the percent of households taking in a
      <i>new dog, fish or bird </i>. Their research also indicated that pets had
      a number of positive influences on their lives such as:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>companionship</li>
      <li>better mental health</li>
      <li>joy and happiness.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      With the increase in pet ownership the AMA are encouraging policy makers
      to consider the needs of companion animals and their owners when
      considering rental, strata and body corporate regulations are well as
      accepting animals in public places and transport.
